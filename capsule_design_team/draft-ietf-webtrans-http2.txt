Abstract

   WebTransport defines a set of low-level communications features
   designed for client-server interactions that are initiated by Web
   clients.  This document describes a protocol that can provide many of
   the capabilities of WebTransport over HTTP/2.  This protocol enables
   the use of WebTransport when a UDP-based protocol is not available.

1.  Introduction

   WebTransport [OVERVIEW] is designed to provide generic communication
   capabilities to Web clients that use HTTP/3 [HTTP3].  The HTTP/3
   WebTransport protocol [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] allows Web clients to use
   QUIC [QUIC] features such as streams or datagrams [DATAGRAM].
   However, there are some environments where QUIC cannot be deployed.

   This document defines a protocol that provides all of the core
   functions of WebTransport using HTTP semantics.  This includes
   unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams, and datagrams.

   By relying only on generic HTTP semantics, this protocol might allow
   deployment using any HTTP version.  However, this document only
   defines negotiation for HTTP/2 [H2] as the current most common TCP-
   based fallback to HTTP/3.

1.1.  Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document follows terminology defined in Section 1.2 of
   [OVERVIEW].  Note that this document distinguishes between a
   WebTransport server and an HTTP/2 server.  An HTTP/2 server is the
   server that terminates HTTP/2 connections; a WebTransport server is
   an application that accepts WebTransport sessions, which can be
   accessed using HTTP/2 and this protocol.

2.  Protocol Overview

   WebTransport servers are identified by an HTTPS URI as defined in
   Section 4.2.2 of [HTTP].

   When an HTTP/2 connection is established, both the client and server
   have to send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting in order to
   indicate that they both support WebTransport over HTTP/2.

   A client initiates a WebTransport session by sending an extended
   CONNECT request [RFC8441].  If the server accepts the request, a
   WebTransport session is established.  The stream that carries the
   CONNECT request is used to exchange bidirectional data for the
   session.  This stream will be referred to as a _CONNECT stream_.  The
   stream ID of a CONNECT stream, which will be referrred to as a
   _Session ID_, is used to uniquely identify a given WebTransport
   session within the connection.  WebTransport using HTTP/2 uses
   extended CONNECT with the same webtransport HTTP Upgrade Token as
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3].  This Upgrade Token uses the Capsule Protocol as
   defined in [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

   After the session is established, endpoints exchange WebTransport
   messages using the Capsule Protocol on the bidirectional CONNECT
   stream, the "data stream" as defined in Section 3.1 of
   [HTTP-DATAGRAM].

   Within this stream, _WebTransport streams_ and _WebTransport
   datagrams_ are multiplexed.  In HTTP/2, WebTransport capsules are
   carried in HTTP/2 DATA frames.  Multiple independent WebTransport
   sessions can share a connection if the HTTP version supports that, as
   HTTP/2 does.

   WebTransport capsules closely mirror a subset of QUIC frames and
   provide the essential WebTransport features.  Within a WebTransport
   session, endpoints can

   *  create and use bidirectional or unidirectional streams with no
      additional round trips using the WT_STREAM capsule

   Stream creation and data flow on streams uses flow control mechanisms
   modeled on those in QUIC.  Flow control is managed using the
   WebTransport capsules: WT_MAX_DATA, WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA,
   WT_MAX_STREAMS, WT_DATA_BLOCKED, WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, and
   WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED.  Flow control for the CONNECT stream as a whole,
   as provided by the HTTP version in use, applies in addition to any
   WebTransport-session-level flow control.

   WebTransport streams can be aborted using a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule
   and a receiver can request that a sender stop sending with a
   WT_STOP_SENDING capsule.

   A WebTransport session is terminated when the CONNECT stream that
   created it is closed.  This implicitly closes all WebTransport
   streams that were multiplexed over that CONNECT stream.

3.  Session Establishment

3.1.  Establishing a Transport-Capable HTTP/2 Connection

   In order to indicate support for WebTransport, both the client and
   the server MUST send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT value set to "1"
   in their SETTINGS frame.  Endpoints MUST NOT use any WebTransport-
   related functionality unless the parameter has been negotiated.

3.2.  Extended CONNECT in HTTP/2

   [RFC8441] defines an extended CONNECT method in Section 4, enabled by
   the SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL parameter.  An endpoint does not
   need to send both SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL and
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT; the SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT
   setting implies that an endpoint supports extended CONNECT.

3.3.  Creating a New Session

   As WebTransport sessions are established over HTTP, they are
   identified using the https URI scheme [RFC7230].

   In order to create a new WebTransport session, a client can send an
   HTTP CONNECT request.  The :protocol pseudo-header field ([RFC8441])
   MUST be set to webtransport (Section 7.1 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3]).  The
   :scheme field MUST be https.  Both the :authority and the :path value
   MUST be set; those fields indicate the desired WebTransport server.
   In a Web context, the request MUST include an Origin header field
   [ORIGIN] that includes the origin of the site that requested the
   creation of the session.

   Upon receiving an extended CONNECT request with a :protocol field set
   to webtransport, the HTTP server checks if the identified resource
   supports WebTransport sessions.  If the resource does not, the server
   SHOULD reply with status code 404 (Section 6.5.4 of [RFC7231]).  If
   it does, it MAY accept the session by replying with a 2xx series
   status code, as defined in Section 15.3 of [SEMANTICS].  The
   WebTransport server MUST verify the Origin header to ensure that the
   specified origin is allowed to access the server in question.

   From the client's perspective, a WebTransport session is established
   when the client receives a 200 response.  From the server's
   perspective, a session is established once it sends a 200 response.
   Both endpoints MUST NOT send any WebTransport capsules on a given
   session before that session is established.

3.4.  Flow Control

3.4.1.  Limiting the Number of Simultaneous Sessions

   From a flow control perspective, WebTransport sessions count against
   HTTP/2 session flow control limits just like regular HTTP requests,
   since they are established via an HTTP CONNECT request.  This
   document does not make any effort to introduce a separate flow
   control mechanism for WebTransport sessions.  If the server needs to
   limit the rate of incoming requests, it has alternative mechanisms at
   its disposal:

   *  HTTP_STREAM_REFUSED error code defined in [RFC7540] indicates to
      the receiving HTTP/2 stack that the request was not processed in
      any way.

   *  HTTP status code 429 indicates that the request was rejected due
      to rate limiting [RFC6585].  Unlike the previous method, this
      signal is directly propagated to the application.

3.4.2.  Flow Control and Intermediaries

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 defines several capsules for flow control,
   and all of these capsules define special intermediary handling as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  These capsules,
   referred to as the "flow control capsules" are WT_MAX_DATA,
   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA, WT_MAX_STREAMS, WT_DATA_BLOCKED,
   WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED, and WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED.

   Because flow control in WebTransport is hop-by-hop and does not
   provide an end-to-end signal, intermediaries MUST consume the flow
   control capsules and not translate or forward incoming flow control
   capsules on any other connections.  Similarly, other WebTransport
   over HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connections will have their own flow control
   limits, and it is the responsibility of the intermediary to generate
   and send appropriate flow control signals to match its capabilities.
   The intermediary can send these signals via HTTP/3 flow control
   messages, HTTP/2 flow control messages, or as WebTransport flow
   control capsules, where appropriate.

4.  WebTransport Features

   WebTransport over TCP-based HTTP semantics provides the following
   features described in [OVERVIEW]: unidirectional streams,
   bidirectional streams, and datagrams, initiated by either endpoint.

   WebTransport streams and datagrams that belong to different
   WebTransport sessions are identified by the CONNECT stream on which
   they are transmitted, with one WebTransport session consuming one
   CONNECT stream.

4.1.  Transport Considerations

   Because WebTransport over TCP-based HTTP semantics relies on the
   underlying protocols to provide in order and reliable delivery, there
   are some notable differences from the way in which QUIC handles
   application data.

   Endpoints MUST send stream data in order.  As there is no ordering
   mechanism available for the receiver to reassemble incoming data,
   receivers assume that all data arriving in WT_STREAM capsules is
   contiguous and in order.

   DATAGRAM capsules are delivered to the remote WebTransport endpoint
   reliably, however this does not require that the receiving
   implementation deliver that data to the application in a reliable
   manner.

4.2.  WebTransport Streams

   WebTransport streams have identifiers and states that mirror the
   identifiers ((Section 2.1 of [RFC9000])) and states (Section 3 of
   [RFC9000]) of QUIC streams as closely as possible to aid in ease of
   implementation.

   WebTransport streams are identified by a numeric value, or stream ID.
   Stream IDs are only meaningful within the WebTransport session in
   which they were created.  They share the same semantics as QUIC
   stream IDs, with client initiated streams having even-numbered stream
   IDs and server-initiated streams having odd-numbered stream IDs.
   Similarly, they can be bidirectional or unidirectional, indicated by
   the second least significant bit of the stream ID.

   Because WebTransport does not provide an acknowledgement mechanism
   for WebTransport capsules, it relies on the underlying transport's in
   order delivery to inform stream state transitions.  Wherever QUIC
   relies on receiving an ack for a packet to transition between stream
   states, WebTransport performs that transition immediately.

5.  WebTransport Capsules

   WebTransport capsules mirror their QUIC frame counterparts as closely
   as possible to enable maximal reuse of any applicable QUIC
   infrastructure by implementors.

   WebTransport capsules follow the Capsule Protocol format defined in {
   {Section 3.2 of HTTP-DATAGRAM}}, containing a Capsule Type and
   Capsule Length which are followed by zero or more bytes of Capsule
   Value that are type-dependent.

   Capsule {
     Capsule Type (i),
     Capsule Length (i),
     Capsule Value (..),
   }

                          Figure 1: Capsule Format

   The Capsule Type field indicates the type of the capsule, defining
   what type-dependent fields will be present.

   The Capsule Length field indicates the length of the WebTransport
   capsule, including all type-dependent fields and other information.
   It does not include the size of the Capsule Type or Capsule Length
   fields themselves.

5.1.  PADDING Capsule

   A PADDING capsule is an HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] of type=0x00 and
   has no semantic value.  PADDING capsules can be used to introduce
   additional data between other HTTP datagrams and can also be used to
   provide protection against traffic analysis or for other reasons.

   PADDING Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x00,
     Length (i),
     Padding (..),
   }

                      Figure 2: PADDING Capsule Format

   The Padding field MUST be set to an all-zero sequence of bytes of any
   length as specified by the Length field.

5.2.  WT_RESET_STREAM Capsule

   A WT_RESET_STREAM capsule is an HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] of
   type=0x04 and allows either endpoint to abruptly terminate the
   sending part of a WebTransport stream.

   After sending a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule, an endpoint ceases
   transmission of WT_STREAM capsules on the identified stream.  A
   receiver of a WT_RESET_STREAM capsule can discard any data that it
   already received on that stream.

   WT_RESET_STREAM Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x04,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Application Protocol Error Code (i),
   }

                  Figure 3: WT_RESET_STREAM Capsule Format

   The WT_RESET_STREAM capsule defines the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer encoding of the WebTransport
      stream ID of the stream being terminated.

   Application Protocol Error Code:  A variable-length integer
      containing the application protocol error code that indicates why
      the stream is being closed.

   Unlike the equivalent QUIC frame, this capsule does not include a
   Final Size field.  In-order delivery of WT_STREAM capsules ensures
   that the amount of session-level flow control consumed by a stream is
   always known by both endpoints.

5.3.  WT_STOP_SENDING Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_STOP_SENDING (type=0x05) is
   introduced to communicate that incoming data is being discarded on
   receipt per application request.  WT_STOP_SENDING requests that a
   peer cease transmission on a WebTransport stream.

   WT_STOP_SENDING Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x05,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Application Protocol Error Code (i),
   }

                  Figure 4: WT_STOP_SENDING Capsule Format

   The WT_STOP_SENDING capsule defines the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer carrying the WebTransport
      stream ID of the stream being ignored.

   Application Protocol Error Code:  A variable-length integer
      containing the application-specified reason the sender is ignoring
      the stream.

5.4.  WT_STREAM Capsule

   WT_STREAM capsules implicitly create a WebTransport stream and carry
   stream data.

   The Type field in the WT_STREAM capsule is either 0x0a or 0x0b.  This
   uses the same capsule types as a QUIC STREAM frame with the OFF bit
   clear and the LEN bit set.  The FIN bit (0x01) in the capsule type
   indicates that the capsule marks the end of the stream in one
   direction.  Stream data consists of any number of 0x0a capsules
   followed by a terminal 0x0b capsule.

   WT_STREAM Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x0a..0x0b,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Stream Data (..),
   }

                     Figure 5: WT_STREAM Capsule Format

   WT_STREAM capsules contain the following fields:

   Stream ID:  The stream ID for the stream.

   Stream Data:  Zero or more bytes of data for the stream.  Empty
      WT_STREAM capsules MUST NOT be used unless they open or close a
      stream; an endpoint MAY treat an empty WT_STREAM capsule that
      neither starts nor ends a stream as a session error.

5.5.  WT_MAX_DATA Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_MAX_DATA (type=0x10) is
   introduced to inform the peer of the maximum amount of data that can
   be sent on the WebTransport session as a whole.

   WT_MAX_DATA Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x10,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Data (i),
   }

                    Figure 6: WT_MAX_DATA Capsule Format

   WT_MAX_DATA capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the maximum
      amount of data that can be sent on the entire connection, in units
      of bytes.

   All data sent in WT_STREAM capsules counts toward this limit.  The
   sum of the lengths of Stream Data fields in WT_STREAM capsules MUST
   NOT exceed the value advertised by a receiver.

   The WT_MAX_DATA capsule defines special intermediary handling, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermedaries MUST
   consume WT_MAX_DATA capsules for flow control purposes and MUST
   generate and send approrpiate flow control signals for their limits;
   see Section 3.4.2.

5.6.  WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA (type=0x11)
   is introduced to inform a peer of the maximum amount of data that can
   be sent on a WebTransport stream.

   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x11,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Maximum Stream Data (i),
   }

                Figure 7: WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA Capsule Format

   WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsules contain the following fields:

   Stream ID:  The stream ID of the affected WebTransport stream,
      encoded as a variable-length integer.

   Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the
      maximum amount of data that can be sent on the identified stream,
      in units of bytes.

   All data sent in WT_STREAM capsules for the identified stream counts
   toward this limit.  The sum of the lengths of Stream Data fields in
   WT_STREAM capsules on the identified stream MUST NOT exceed the value
   advertised by a receiver.

   The WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsule defines special intermediary handling,
   as described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermedaries MUST
   consume WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA capsules for flow control purposes and
   MUST generate and send approrpiate flow control signals for their
   limits; see Section 3.4.2.

5.7.  WT_MAX_STREAMS Capsule

   An HTTP capsule [HTTP-DATAGRAM] called WT_MAX_STREAMS is introduced
   to inform the peer of the cumulative number of streams of a given
   type it is permitted to open.  A WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule with a type
   of 0x12 applies to bidirectional streams, and a WT_MAX_STREAMS
   capsule with a type of 0x13 applies to unidirectional streams.

   WT_MAX_STREAMS Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x12..0x13,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Streams (i),
   }

                  Figure 8: WT_MAX_STREAMS Capsule Format

   WT_MAX_STREAMS capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Streams:  A count of the cumulative number of streams of the
      corresponding type that can be opened over the lifetime of the
      connection.  This value cannot exceed 2^60, as it is not possible
      to encode stream IDs larger than 2^62-1.

   An endpoint MUST NOT open more streams than permitted by the current
   stream limit set by its peer.  For instance, a server that receives a
   unidirectional stream limit of 3 is permitted to open streams 3, 7,
   and 11, but not stream 15.

   Note that this limit includes streams that have been closed as well
   as those that are open.

   The WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule defines special intermediary handling, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermedaries MUST
   consume WT_MAX_STREAMS capsules for flow control purposes and MUST
   generate and send approrpiate flow control signals for their limits;
   see Section 3.4.2.

5.8.  WT_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule

   A sender SHOULD send a WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsule (type=0x14) when it
   wishes to send data but is unable to do so due to WebTransport
   session-level flow control.  WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsules can be used as
   input to tuning of flow control algorithms.

   WT_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x14,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Data (i),
   }

                  Figure 9: WT_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule Format

   WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the session-level
      limit at which blocking occurred.

   The WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsule defines special intermediary handling, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermedaries MUST
   consume WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsules for flow control purposes and MUST
   generate and send approrpiate flow control signals for their limits;
   see Section 3.4.2.

5.9.  WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule

   A sender SHOULD send a WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule (type=0x15)
   when it wishes to send data but is unable to do so due to stream-
   level flow control.  This capsule is analogous to WT_DATA_BLOCKED.

   WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x15,
     Length (i),
     Stream ID (i),
     Maximum Stream Data (i),
   }

              Figure 10: WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED Capsule Format

   WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsules contain the following fields:

   Stream ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the WebTransport
      stream that is blocked due to flow control.

   Maximum Stream Data:  A variable-length integer indicating the offset
      of the stream at which the blocking occurred.

   The WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule defines special intermediary
   handling, as described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].
   Intermedaries MUST consume WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsules for flow
   control purposes and MUST generate and send approrpiate flow control
   signals for their limits; see Section 3.4.2.

5.10.  WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED Capsule

   A sender SHOULD send a WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule (type=0x16 or 0x17)
   when it wishes to open a stream but is unable to do so due to the
   maximum stream limit set by its peer.  A WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule
   of type 0x16 is used to indicate reaching the bidirectional stream
   limit, and a STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule of type 0x17 is used to indicate
   reaching the unidirectional stream limit.

   A WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule does not open the stream, but informs
   the peer that a new stream was needed and the stream limit prevented
   the creation of the stream.

   WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x16..0x17,
     Length (i),
     Maximum Streams (i),
   }

                Figure 11: WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED Capsule Format

   WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsules contain the following field:

   Maximum Streams:  A variable-length integer indicating the maximum
      number of streams allowed at the time the capsule was sent.  This
      value cannot exceed 2^60, as it is not possible to encode stream
      IDs larger than 2^62-1.

   The WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule defines special intermediary handling,
   as described in Section 3.2 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM].  Intermedaries MUST
   consume WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsules for flow control purposes and
   MUST generate and send approrpiate flow control signals for their
   limits; see Section 3.4.2.

6.  DATAGRAM Capsule

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 uses the DATAGRAM capsule defined in
   Section 3.5 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM] to carry datagram traffic.

   DATAGRAM Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0x00,
     Length (i),
     HTTP Datagram Payload (..),
   }

                     Figure 12: DATAGRAM Capsule Format

   When used in WebTransport over HTTP/2, DATAGRAM capsules contain the
   following fields:

   HTTP Datagram Payload:  The content of the datagram to be delivered.

   The data in DATAGRAM capsules is not subject to flow control.  The
   receiver MAY discard this data if it does not have sufficient space
   to buffer it.

   An intermediary could forward the data in a DATAGRAM capsule over
   another protocol, such as WebTransport over HTTP/3.  In QUIC, a
   datagram frame can span at most one packet.  Because of that, the
   applications have to know the maximum size of the datagram they can
   send.  However, when proxying the datagrams, the hop-by-hop MTUs can
   vary.

   Section 3.5 of [HTTP-DATAGRAM] indicates that intermediaries that
   forward DATAGRAM capsules where QUIC datagrams [DATAGRAM] are
   available forward the contents of the capsule as native QUIC
   datagrams, rather than as HTTP datagrams in a DATAGRAM capsule.
   Similarly, when forwarding DATAGRAM capsules used as part of a
   WebTransport over HTTP/2 session on a WebTransport session that
   natively supports QUIC datagrams, such as WebTransport over HTTP/3
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H3], intermediaries SHOULD use native QUIC datagrams.

7.  Examples

   An example of negotiating a WebTransport Stream on an HTTP/2
   connection follows.  This example is intended to closely follow the
   example in Section 5.1 of [RFC8441] to help illustrate the
   differences defined in this document.

   [[ From Client ]]                   [[ From Server ]]

   SETTINGS
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT = 1

                                       SETTINGS
                                       SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT = 1

   HEADERS + END_HEADERS
   Stream ID = 3
   :method = CONNECT
   :protocol = webtransport
   :scheme = https
   :path = /
   :authority = server.example.com
   origin: server.example.com

                                       HEADERS + END_HEADERS
                                       Stream ID = 3
                                       :status = 200

   WT_STREAM
   Stream ID = 5
   WebTransport Data

                                       WT_STREAM + FIN
                                       Stream ID = 5
                                       WebTransport Data

   WT_STREAM + FIN
   Stream ID = 5
   WebTransport Data

   An example of the server initiating a WebTransport Stream follows.
   The only difference here is the endpoint that sends the first
   WT_STREAM capsule.

   [[ From Client ]]                   [[ From Server ]]

   SETTINGS
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT = 1

                                       SETTINGS
                                       SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT = 1

   HEADERS + END_HEADERS
   Stream ID = 3
   :method = CONNECT
   :protocol = webtransport
   :scheme = https
   :path = /
   :authority = server.example.com
   origin: server.example.com
                                       HEADERS + END_HEADERS
                                       Stream ID = 3
                                       :status = 200

                                       WT_STREAM
                                       Stream ID = 2
                                       WebTransport Data

   WT_STREAM + FIN
   Stream ID = 2
   WebTransport Data

                                       WT_STREAM + FIN
                                       Stream ID = 2
                                       WebTransport Data

8.  Session Termination

   An WebTransport session over HTTP/2 is terminated when either
   endpoint closes the stream associated with the CONNECT request that
   initiated the session.  Upon learning about the session being
   terminated, the endpoint MUST stop sending new datagrams and reset
   all of the streams associated with the session.

9.  Transport Properties

   The WebTransport capsulework [OVERVIEW] defines a set of optional
   transport properties that clients can use to determine the presence
   of features which might allow additional optimizations beyond the
   common set of properties available via all WebTransport protocols.
   Below are details about support in Http2Transport for those
   properties.

   Stream Independence:  Http2Transport does not support stream
      independence, as HTTP/2 inherently has head of line blocking.

   Partial Reliability:  Http2Transport does not support partial
      reliability, as HTTP/2 retransmits any lost data.  This means that
      any datagrams sent via Http2Transport will be retransmitted
      regardless of the preference of the application.  The receiver is
      permitted to drop them, however, if it is unable to buffer them.

   Pooling Support:  Http2Transport supports pooling, as multiple
      transports using Http2Transport may share the same underlying
      HTTP/2 connection and therefore share a congestion controller and
      other transport context.

   Connection Mobility:  Http2Transport does not support connection
      mobility, unless an underlying transport protocol that supports
      multipath or migration, such as MPTCP [MPTCP], is used underneath
      HTTP/2 and TLS.  Without such support, Http2Transport connections
      cannot survive network transitions.

10.  Security Considerations

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 satisfies all of the security requirements
   imposed by [OVERVIEW] on WebTransport protocols, thus providing a
   secure framework for client-server communication in cases when the
   client is potentially untrusted.

   WebTransport over HTTP/2 requires explicit opt-in through the use of
   HTTP SETTINGS; this avoids potential protocol confusion attacks by
   ensuring the HTTP/2 server explicitly supports it.  It also requires
   the use of the Origin header, providing the server with the ability
   to deny access to Web-based clients that do not originate from a
   trusted origin.

   Just like HTTP traffic going over HTTP/2, WebTransport pools traffic
   to different origins within a single connection.  Different origins
   imply different trust domains, meaning that the implementations have
   to treat each transport as potentially hostile towards others on the
   same connection.  One potential attack is a resource exhaustion
   attack: since all of the transports share both congestion control and
   flow control context, a single client aggressively using up those
   resources can cause other transports to stall.  The user agent thus
   SHOULD implement a fairness scheme that ensures that each transport
   within connection gets a reasonable share of controlled resources;
   this applies both to sending data and to opening new streams.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  HTTP/2 SETTINGS Parameter Registration

   The following entry is added to the "HTTP/2 Settings" registry
   established by [RFC7540]:
